:title: Deploy an Application on Deis
:description: First steps for developers using Deis to deploy and manage applications

.. _deploy-application:

Deploy an Application
=====================
An :ref:`Application` is deployed to Deis using ``git push`` or the ``deis`` client.

Supported Applications
----------------------
Deis can deploy any application or service that can run inside a Docker container.  In order to be scaled horizontally, applications must follow Heroku's `twelve-factor methodology`_ and store state in external backing services.

For example, if your application persists state to the local filesystem -- common with content management systems like Wordpress and Drupal -- it cannot be scaled horizonally using ``deis scale``.

Fortunately, most modern applications feature a stateless application tier that can scale horizontally inside Deis.

Login to the Controller
-----------------------
Before deploying an application, users must first authenticate against the Deis :ref:`Controller`.

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis login http://deis.example.com
    username: deis
    password:
    Logged in as deis

Select a Build Process
----------------------
Deis supports three different ways of building applications:

 1. `Heroku Buildpack`_
 2. `Dockerfile`_
 3. `Docker Image`_

Buildpacks
^^^^^^^^^^
Heroku buildpacks are useful if you want to follow Heroku's best practices for building applications or if you are porting an application from Heroku.

Dockerfiles
^^^^^^^^^^^
Dockerfiles are a powerful way to define a portable execution environment built on a base OS of your choosing.

Docker Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deploying a Docker image onto Deis allows you to take a Docker image from either a public
or a private registry and copy it over bit-for-bit, ensuring that you are running the same
image in development or in your CI pipeline as you are in production.
